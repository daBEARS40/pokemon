Working with PokeApi

If you're reading this, you're probably Brylan. What is up my dudeee!

This is a personal project designed to mimic a pokedex. Recently learned the basics on how to use & develop an API,
so I figured I'd practice using and working with Api's in my personal time.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a quick, responsive website where a user can search the name of any Pokemon,
and once a pokemon is selected it will display their sprite & details about the pokemon. The requirements may grow over time, as
I'd like it to be more fully-featured down the line. Features like a team-builder, poke-ball details, pokemon location information, etc
will all come much later.

This project uses technologies I've recently learned in a professional setting. Frameworks like Knockout & RequireJS are dated by
today's standards, but as far as I can tell, they're reliable and easy to work with, and have plenty of online documentation
for any potential issues & errors.

For now, the project will be almost entirely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eventually, I may store the pokemon details locally and write
my own Api in Java to interact with the data. As of now, that's a pipe dream. I'd have to learn a lot more about networking, using tomcat,
managing active servers, way too much to think about right now. As it is - thanks PokeApi for hosting the data!
